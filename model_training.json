This is fortunate for the business as maintenance and saftey issues are few, but causes an imbalance in the label distribution. This imbalance leads to poor performance as algorithms tend to classify majority class examples at the expense of minority class, since the total misclassification error is much improved when majority class is labeled correctly. This causes low recall or precision rates, although accuracy can be high. It becomes a larger problem when the cost of false alarms is very high. To help with this problem, sampling techniques such as oversampling of the minority examples can be used. These methods are not covered in this notebook. Because of this, it is also important to look at evaluation metrics other than accuracy alone.\n# \n# We will build and compare two different classification model approaches:\n# \n#  - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Decision trees and their ensembles are popular methods for the machine learning tasks of classification and regression. Decision trees are widely used since they are easy to interpret, handle categorical features, extend to the multiclass classification setting, do not require feature scaling, and are able to capture non-linearities and feature interactions.\n# \n#  - **Random Forest Classifier**: A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees. Random forests combine many decision trees in order to reduce the risk of overfitting. Tree ensemble algorithms such as random forests and boosting are among the top performers for classification and regression tasks.\n\n\nmodel_type = 'DecisionTree' # Use 'DecisionTree', or 'RandomForest'\n\n# train a model.\nif model_type == 'DecisionTree':\n    model = DecisionTreeClassifier(labelCol=\"indexedLabel\", featuresCol=\"indexedFeatures\",\n                                      # Maximum depth of the tree.

The second number in the second row, indicates how many days we correctly predicted a component 1 failure within the next 7 days.\n# \n# We read the confusion matrix numbers along the diagonal as correctly classifying the component failures.
